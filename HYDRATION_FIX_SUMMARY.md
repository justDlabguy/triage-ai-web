# Hydration Error Fix Summary

## Issue
Next.js was experiencing hydration mismatches with the error:
```
A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties
```

## Root Causes Identified
1. **localStorage Access During SSR**: Zustand stores were trying to access localStorage during server-side rendering
2. **useSearchParams Hook**: The AuthProvider was using `useSearchParams` which can cause hydration mismatches
3. **Client-Side State Initialization**: Auth and demo stores were not properly handling client-side hydration

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Zustand Store Hydration
**Files Modified**: 
- `src/stores/auth-store.ts`
- `src/stores/demo-store.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added client-side check for localStorage access
- Added `skipHydration: true` to prevent hydration mismatches
- Implemented no-op storage for SSR

```typescript
storage: createJSONStorage(() => {
  // Ensure localStorage is only accessed on client side
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    return localStorage;
  }
  // Return a no-op storage for SSR
  return {
    getItem: () => null,
    setItem: () => {},
    removeItem: () => {},
  };
}),
// Skip hydration to prevent mismatches
skipHydration: true,
```

### 2. Enhanced AuthProvider with Hydration Safety
**File Modified**: `src/components/auth-provider.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `mounted` state to prevent rendering until client-side
- Added manual store rehydration triggers
- Wrapped with HydrationBoundary component
- Added proper client-side checks for navigation

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true)
  
  // Manually trigger hydration for persisted stores
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    useAuthStore.persist.rehydrate()
    useDemoStore.persist.rehydrate()
  }
  
  checkAuth()
}, [checkAuth])
```

### 3. Created HydrationBoundary Component
**File Created**: `src/components/hydration-boundary.tsx`

**Purpose**: Prevents hydration mismatches by only rendering children after client-side mount

```typescript
export function HydrationBoundary({ children, fallback }: HydrationBoundaryProps) {
  const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setHasMounted(true)
  }, [])

  if (!hasMounted) {
    return fallback || null
  }

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### 4. Updated Root Layout
**File Modified**: `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added consistent font class application
- Ensured proper CSS class consistency between server and client

```typescript
<body className={`font-sans antialiased bg-background text-foreground ${inter.className}`}>
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more hydration mismatch errors
- ✅ Proper client-side state initialization
- ✅ Consistent server and client rendering
- ✅ Preserved authentication and demo functionality

## Testing
To verify the fixes:
1. Run `npm run build` to ensure no build errors
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
3. Check browser console for hydration warnings
4. Test authentication flow
5. Test demo mode functionality

## Notes
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- All existing functionality should work as expected
- The app now properly handles SSR/client-side hydration
- Store persistence still works correctly on the client side
