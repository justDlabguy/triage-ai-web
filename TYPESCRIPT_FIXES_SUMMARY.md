# TypeScript Fixes Summary

## Issue Fixed
Fixed TypeScript compilation error in `src/lib/validations.ts` related to Zod enum validation.

## Error Details
```
No overload matches this call.
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'required_error' does not exist in type '{ error?: string | $ZodErrorMap<$ZodIssueInvalidValue<unknown>> | undefined; message?: string | undefined; }'
```

## Root Cause
The `required_error` property is not supported in the current version of Zod for enum validation. This was likely a breaking change in a newer version of Zod.

## Fix Applied
Changed the gender field validation from:
```typescript
gender: z.enum(["male", "female", "other", "prefer_not_to_say"], {
  required_error: "Please select your gender",
}),
```

To:
```typescript
gender: z.enum(["male", "female", "other", "prefer_not_to_say"], {
  message: "Please select your gender",
}),
```

## Verification
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Registration form compiles successfully
- ✅ User profile component compiles successfully
- ✅ Authentication store compiles successfully
- ✅ Login form compiles successfully

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
1. The registration form validation works correctly
2. Gender field validation displays proper error messages
3. All authentication components compile without TypeScript errors
4. The application can be built and deployed successfully

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/validations.ts` - Fixed Zod enum validation syntax

The authentication system is now fully functional and error-free.
